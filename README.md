# Welcome to A Bit Better Than Yesterday

I am Aloys a developer based in Brisbane, in Australia.
A Bit Better Than Yesterday is my personal web corner, where I share my thoughts, learning, opinions and projects.

You might also come across some non-code-related stuff, such as my passion for outdoor sports. Turns out there is more than coding to life!

Feel free to poke around my website and stay as long as you wish.

This is a space for me to publish my thoughts, learnings and mistakes.

I have multiple projects at the moment, one of them being the website you're currently on.

For the past few years, I meant to open a digital-garden-like website. Well, here it is.

This site is powered by **Astro**. I take my notes on **Obsidian** and publish using a custom **Deno** script.

I might dedicate a post about it in the blog section at some stage.

Don't hesitate to reach out and let me know what you think!
