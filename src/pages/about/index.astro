  <p>What would like to know more about?</p>

  <AboutCollapseSection title="Myself, as a person" key={1}>
    <p>Let's start with the most important bit: the non-work related stuff.</p>

    <p>I enjoy and practice outdoor sports quite a bit.</p>
    <p>Right now, I tend to spend my weekends either kitesurfing or surfing.</p>
    <p>
      In the past, I spent a lot of time in the Alps, practicing acrobatic
      paragliding, skiing or simply tramping up the mountains.

  <AboutCollapseSection title ={"Myself, as a developer"} key={2}>
  <p>I am currently working as front-end developper in Brisbane.</p>
  <p>
    In the past, I mainly worked as a fullstack developper - but my area of
    expertise remains in the front end.
  </p>
  <p>I have worked in production with different technologies and frameworks.</p>

  <p>
    On the front side, I had the chance to work in production with all the main
    frameworks: Vue, React, Svelte, Angular and even AngularJS.
  </p>
  <p>
    I don't fret over vanilla JS, but I do see the value of reaching one to a
    framework **when needed**.
  </p>
  <p>
    Speaking of JS, I rarely used JavaScript anymore - I have switched to
    TypeScript for 99% of my work for a few years now.
  </p>

  <p>
    For the backend, my tool of choice as a freelancer has been Laravel as it
    gets the job done - but these days, I would probably reach out to a JS
    back-end framework to limit context switching.
  </p>
  <p>I also had the chance to dabble in Rust when working in San Francisco.</p>

  <AboutCollapseSection title="Next goals" key={3}>

  <p>This year, I am experimenting with the 12 Weeks Year.</p>
  <p>
    Without going into details, the idea is to approach your year in four
    chunks, in a sort-of agile way.
  </p>

  <p>The goals for my next 12 weeks are:</p>

  <p>
    - Getting this website off the ground (I have meant to do so for two years
    now!),
  </p>
  <p>- Loose 6 kgs</p>
  <p>- Financial</p>

  <AboutCollapseSection title="About this website" key={4}>
  <p>
    I have few projects going on at the minute, one of thenm being the website
    you're currently on.
  </p>
  <p>
    For the past few years, I meant to open a digital-garden-like website, and
    here it is.
  </p>
  

  <p></p>
  <p>
    This site is powered by Astro, and it's where I spend most of my outside of
    work
