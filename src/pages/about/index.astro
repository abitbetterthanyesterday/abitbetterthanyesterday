  <AboutCollapseSection title="Myself, as a person" key={1}>
    <p>Let's start with the most important bit: the non-work related stuff.</p>
    <p>
      I am born and raised french üá´üá∑ü•ñü•ê but I have been living mostly in
      Australia üá¶üá∫ü¶òüê® since 2014.
    </p>
    <p>I enjoy and practice <strong>outdoor sports</strong> quite a lot.</p>
    <p>
      Right now, I tend to spend my weekends either <strong>kitesurfing</strong>
      or <strong>surfing</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the past, I spent a lot of time in the Alps, <strong
        >practicing acrobatic paragliding, skiing or simply tramping up the
        mountains</strong
      >.
    </p>
    <p>
      I also lived with my partner M, <strong
        >on Zef, a Mottle 33' sailboat for almost two years</strong
      >.
    </p>
    <p>
      I <strong>read a lot</strong>, fictions, non-fictions. Usually, the
      non-fiction stuff is to wind down after work days.
    </p>
    <p>
      <u
        >I try to make the most out my days, it's both a blessing and a curse.</u
      >
    </p>
    <p>Beyond that, believe it or not, we live quite a simple life!</p>

    <p>
      Since my partner has introduced me to the VIA Characters strengths, it has
      really improve my self-knowledge
    </p>
    <p>
      I would <strong>highy</strong> encourage anyone out there to take the test
      and learn more about themselves.
    </p>
    <p>These are my results, my top 5 strengths.</p>
    <ol>
      {
        VIAStrength.sort((a, b) => (a.order < b.order ? -1 : 1)).map(
          ({ name, link }) => {
            return (
              <li>
                <a href={link} target="_blank">
                  {name}
                </a>
              </li>
            );
          }
        )

  <AboutCollapseSection title={"Myself, as a developer"} key={2}>
    <p>I am working as <strong> front-end developper</strong> in Brisbane.</p>
    <p>
      In the past, I worked as a <strong>fullstack developper</strong> - but my area
      of expertise remains in the front end.
    </p>

    <p>
      I have worked in production with numerous technologies and frameworks.
    </p>

    <p>
      On the front side, I had the chance to work in production with all the
      <strong>main frameworks</strong>: Vue, React, Svelte, Angular and even
      AngularJS.
    </p>
    <p>
      I don't fret over vanilla JS, but I do see the value of reaching one to a
      framework when needed, even its only purpose is to force <strong
        >convention</strong
      >.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having said that, I am looking forward to more web components! <strong
        >Lit</strong
      > is on my curiosity list.
    </p>
    <p>
      Speaking of JS, I rarely used JavaScript anymore - I have switched to
      <strong>TypeScript for 99% of my work</strong> for a few years now.
    </p>

    <p>
      For the backend, <strong
        >my tool of choice as a freelancer has historically been Laravel</strong
      > as it gets the job done - but these days, <s
        >I would probably reach out to a JS back-end framework to limit context
        switching</s
      >
      <b>I would choose serverless technologies coupled with Prisma</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
      I also had the chance to dabble in <strong>Rust</strong> when working in San
      Francisco, which has really improved my coding. I would love to spend more
      time working with technologies such as Go or Rust, but most of the time I would
      grab
      <strong>Deno or Node to get the job done</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am always curious to learn more and I have spent time trying different
      technologies.
    </p>
    <p>
      I strive to write <strong
        >code as maintainable and clean as possible</strong
      > - although it's always challenging in real life with business constraints.
    </p>
    <p>
      I enjoy testing as it creates a buffer before coding which allows to
      'plan' the code. If possible, I would always practice a loose <strong
        >TDD</strong
      >.
    </p>

    <p>
      When it comes to testing, I have tried many different approach and I think
      I'm starting to get a good grasp on how to test user interface. My weapons
      of choice are <strong>Cypress</strong> and <strong>Jest</strong>, coupled
      with the
      <strong>Testing Library.</strong>

      <p>
        Funnily enough, I am not a very 'techy' person. You won't find me gaming
        or wearing the latest smartwatch. Hey, I don't even have a TV (or
        streaming services!). I leave my phone behind whenever the occasion
        arise!
      </p>
      <p>
        But I love coding to craft solutions. I find the job of software
        developer very, very rewarding.
      </p>
      <p>
        My years as freelancer were very fulfilling: I have seen the impact that
        writing code can have on people.

  <AboutCollapseSection title="Next goals" key={3}>
    <p>This year, I am experimenting with the 12 Weeks Year.</p>
    <p>I will write a review of the book, it was quite an interesting read.</p>
    <p>
      Without going into details, the idea is to approach your year in four
      chunks, in a sort-of agile way.
    </p>

    <p>The goals for my next 12 weeks are:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Getting this website off the ground: I have meant to do so for two years
        now!
      </li>
      <li>
        Finish a side project. This side project being 'Get out' - and you'll
        hear more about it in the blog section
      </li>
      <li>
        Loose 6 kilogramms. I intend to run a marathon later this year, I want
        to put all the odds in my favor.
      </li>
      <li>Some financial which I won't share here, for privacy reasons</li>
    </ul>
  </AboutCollapseSection>

  <AboutCollapseSection title="About this website" key={4}>
    <p>Feel free to poke around my website and stay as long as you wish.</p>
    <p>
      This is a space for me to publish my thoughts, learnings and mistakes.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have few projects going on at the minute, one of them being the website
      you're currently on.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the past few years, I meant to open a digital-garden-like website, and
      here it is.
    </p>
    <p>
      This site is powered by <strong>Astro</strong>. I will dedicate a post
      about it in the blog section.
