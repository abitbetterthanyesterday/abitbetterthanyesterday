My partner has introduced me to the VIA Characters' strengths, I have been raving about since then.

I feel like I had a good grasp on who I was, yet seeing the results has challenged some of my thoughts and has improved my self-knowledge.

I would **highy** encourage anyone out there to take the test and learn more about themselves.

It is a great way to discover your strengths and exploit them.

These are my results, my top 5 strengths:

- [Curiosity](https://www.viacharacter.org/character-strengths/curiosity)
- [Humor](https://www.viacharacter.org/character-strengths/humor)
- [Love of Learning](https://www.viacharacter.org/character-strengths/love-of-learning),
- [Zest](https://www.viacharacter.org/character-strengths/zest)
- [Bravery](https://www.viacharacter.org/character-strengths/bravery)
