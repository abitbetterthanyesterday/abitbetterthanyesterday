title: Myself, as a developer
order: 3

I am working as **front-end developper** in Brisbane.

In the past, I worked as a **fullstack developper** - but my area of expertise gravitates towards the front end.

I have worked in production with numerous technologies and frameworks.

On the front side, I had the chance to work in production with all the **main frameworks**: Vue, React, Svelte, Angular and even **AngularJS**.

I don't mind vanilla JS, but I do see the value of reaching one to a framework when needed, even it's only purpose is to force **convention**. That's a reason valid enough for me, large projects need convention!

Having said that, I am looking forward to more web components for performance and portability. **Lit** is on my curiosity list.

Speaking of JS, I rarely used JavaScript anymore - I have switched to **TypeScript for 99% of my work** for a few years now. I don't think I have used much JS in my career at all, except when dealing with legacy code.

For the backend, **my tool of choice as a freelancer has historically been Laravel** as it gets the job done - but these days, I would probably reach out to a JS back-end framework to limit context switching. **Prisma** with a nice **graphQL** interface often gives you enough flexibility for the most common web applications.

I also had the chance to dabble in **Rust** when working in San Francisco, which has strongly improved my coding. I would love to spend more time working with technologies such as **Go** or **Rust**, but most of the time I would grab **Deno or Node to get the job done**. I am currently learning more about **Go** as it appears to have a low barrier of entry when it comes to **multi-threading**.

I am always curious to learn more and I have spent time trying different technologies.

I strive to write **code as maintainable and clean as possible** - although it's always challenging in real life with business constraints.

I enjoy testing as it creates a buffer before coding which allows me to 'plan' the code. If possible, I would always practice a loose **TDD** approach.

When it comes to testing, I have tried many different approaches and I think I'm starting to get a good grasp on what to test in graphical user interfaces. My weapons of choice are **Cypress** and **Jest**, coupled with the **Testing Library.**

Funnily enough, I am not a very 'techy' person outside of coding. You won't find me often gaming or wearing the latest smartwatch. Hey, I don't even have a TV (or streaming services!). I leave my phone behind whenever the occasion arises!

But I **love coding** to craft solutions. I find the job of software developer very, _very_ rewarding.
My years as a freelancer were extremely fulfilling: I have seen the impact that writing code can have on people first hand.
