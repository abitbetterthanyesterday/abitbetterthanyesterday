title: Next goals
order: 4
---

This year, I am experimenting with the 12 Weeks Year.

I will write a review of the book in the blog section; it was quite an interesting read.

Without going too much into detail, the idea is to break down your year in four chunks.
For each of these chunks, you set yourself up to 3 goals along with strategies to reach them.
Each week, you measure your success rate and take corrective actions if necessary.

We could say it's goal setting, the agile way!

The goals for my next 12 weeks are:

- Getting this website off the ground: I have meant to do so for two years now!
- Loose 6 kilograms. I intend to run a marathon later this year, I want to put all the odds in my favor, _edit: the marathon is happening, on the Gold Coast on the 2nd of July!_  
- A financial goal. I won't share it here, for privacy reasons,
