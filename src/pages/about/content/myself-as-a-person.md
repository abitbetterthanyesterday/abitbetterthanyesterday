title: Myself, as a person

Let's start with the most important bit: the non-work related stuff.

I am born and raised **french** but I have been living mostly in **Australia** since 2014. My partner is Australian.

I enjoy and practice **outdoor sports** quite a lot.

Right now, I tend to spend my weekends either **kitesurfing** or **surfing**.

In the past, I spent a lot of time in the Alps, **practicing acrobatic paragliding, skiing or simply tramping up and down the mountains**.

I also lived with my partner **on Zef, a Mottle 33' sailboat for almost two years**.

I **read a lot**, fictions, non-fictions. Usually, the fiction stuff is to wind down after work days.

<u>I try to make the most out my days, it's both a blessing and a curse.</u>

Beyond that, believe it or not, we live quite a simple life!
