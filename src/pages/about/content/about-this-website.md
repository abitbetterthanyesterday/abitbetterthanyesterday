Feel free to poke around my website and stay as long as you wish.

This is a space for me to publish my thoughts, learnings and mistakes.

I have multiple projects at the moment, one of them being the website you're currently on.

For the past few years, I meant to open a digital-garden-like website. Well, here it is.

This site is powered by **Astro**. I take my notes on **Obsidian** and publish using a custom **Deno** script.

I might dedicate a post about it in the blog section at some stage.

Let me know what you think!
