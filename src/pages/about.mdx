# About

Hi, I'm Aloys, or simply Alo.

## As a person
Let's start with the most important bit: the non-work related stuff.

I enjoy and practice outdoor sports quite a bit.
Right now, I tend to spend my weekends either kitesurfing or surfing.
In the past, I spent a lot of time in the Alps, practicing acrobatic paragliding, skiing or simply tramping up the mountains.

## As a developer
I am currently working as front-end developper in Brisbane.

In the past, I mainly worked as a fullstack developper - but my area of expertise remains in the front end.
I have worked in production with different technologies and frameworks.

On the front side, I had the chance to work in production with all the main frameworks: Vue, React, Svelte, Angular and even AngularJS.
I don't fret over vanilla JS, but I do see the value of reaching one to a framework **when needed**.
Speaking of JS, I rarely used JavaScript anymore - I have switched to TypeScript for 99% of my work for a few years now.

For the backend, my tool of choice as a freelancer has been Laravel as it gets the job done - but these days, I would probably reach out to a JS back-end framework to limit context switching.
I also had the chance to dabble in Rust when working in San Francisco.

## Next goals
This year, I am experimenting with the 12 Weeks Year.
Without going into details, the idea is to approach your year in four chunks, in a sort-of agile way.

The goals for my next 12 weeks are:
- Getting this website off the ground (I have meant to do so for two years now!),
- Loose 6 kgs
- Financial

I have few projects going on at the minute, one of thenm being the website you're currently on.
For the past few years, I meant to open a digital-garden-like website, and here it is.

This site is powered by Astro, and it's where I spend most of my outside of work

Feel free to poke around my website and stay as long as you wish.
I publish my thoughts, learnings and mistakes.

If you find anything that spark you attention, feel free to reach out.
I am always keen to connect with people.

Alo.
